## üß† Project Overview

CodeLogic is more than a chatbot ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **data science-backed platform** designed to personalize tutoring based on prompt complexity, user intent, and historical data patterns. Using **OpenAI's API**, the system generates dynamic responses to coding and math questions, while also collecting and analyzing usage data to improve performance and topic relevance.

## üî¨ Data Science & Analysis

The backend logs user prompts and AI responses to a structured CSV format. Using **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn** in **Jupyter Notebooks**, I performed an in-depth analysis on 100 real user queries:

- Clustered prompts using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **KMeans** to categorize question types
- Identified key topic trends such as dominant interest in **calculus** and **Python programming**
- Measured question and response complexity via word counts and response length distributions
- Visualized semantic similarity between topics using **cosine similarity heatmaps**
- Extracted top TF-IDF terms per cluster to uncover key user vocabulary
- Built a full Markdown report summarizing all findings, trends, and interpretations

This analysis allowed me to **better understand user behavior** and informed how I designed both the interface and backend logic.
